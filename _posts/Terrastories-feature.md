## What is Terrastories
Terrastories is a geostorytelling application built to enable Indigenous and other local communities to locate and map their own oral storytelling traditions about places of significant meaning or value to them.

## The Issue:
 I contributed to the Terrastories application by implementing a feature that allows admin users to upload their own SVG icon for the map's home button. This involved creating a database migration in Ruby on Rails to store the icon, updating the model to handle file uploads with ActiveStorage, and integrating a React component for admins to upload their SVG file seamlessly. I also adjusted the backend to handle and save the uploaded file properly. Although this feature has been pushed to my repository fork, it is still pending review. This experience was a valuable detour from my main focus on my capstone project, blending front and backend development to enhance user customization in Terrastories.
